# Utility-Examples - MimicGrabber


When building, don't forget to remove and re-add ClearSCADA references so they match your installed version!

# MimicGrabber
Get a screenshot of one or more mimics automatically. This program will let you select which mimics to get screenshots, and save then in PNG format.

It will run ViewX and display/copy each mimic in turn.
