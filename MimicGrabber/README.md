The source code is available for you to freely use, modify and extend to 
suit your requirements or that of your clients. It is perhaps not the 
most optimized, efficient or elegant code but we hope that its simplicity 
will encourage engagement with Geo SCADA.

When building, don't forget to remove and re-add ClearSCADA references so they match your installed version!

# MimicGrabber
Get a screenshot of one or more mimics automatically. This program will let you select which mimics to get screenshots, and save then in PNG format.

It will run ViewX and display/copy each mimic in turn.
