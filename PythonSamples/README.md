# Python Samples
Some simple files showing how to use Python to interact with Geo SCADA using the .Net Client API.

Filenames indicate the functions they demonstrate.

Please note that the popular 'Pythonnet' library is used to call .Net functions. This is
supported on Python versions up to 3.8 and perhaps more currently.

Download Python from https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.10/python-3.8.10-amd64.exe
After installing, add pythonnet by opening the command line and typing

 pip install Pythonnet

To use these examples please enter your Geo SCADA login credentials into the code.
