# Python Samples
Some simple files showing how to use Python to interact with Geo SCADA using the .Net Client API.

Note that Python in Geo SCADA 2025 has a native library and there are separate examples available. Please refer to the repository Python Geo SCADA Client Samples.

Filenames indicate the functions they demonstrate.

Please note that the popular 'Pythonnet' library is used to call .Net functions. This is
supported on various Python versions.

Download Python (e.g. from https://www.python.org)
After installing, add pythonnet by opening the command line and typing

 pip install Pythonnet

To use these examples please enter your Geo SCADA login credentials into the code.
